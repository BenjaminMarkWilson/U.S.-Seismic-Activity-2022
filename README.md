# U.S.-Seismic-Activity-2022
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) collects data on all seismic activity in the US, as well as some of the seismic activity in other countries. While there is much certainty about where earthqaukes will occur, the same cannot be said about when; my goal was to analyze the seismic activity in the U.S. during 2022 to see if any factors could be used to indicate that a damage-causing earthquake was eminent. The Jupyter Notebook file contains both the Python code from my analysis and some visualizations, however the majority of the visuals can be located in the Tableau story that was included. Any feedback about my code or methodology would be appreciated!
